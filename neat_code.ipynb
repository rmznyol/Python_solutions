    "k = k % len(nums): This line takes the modulus of k with the length of the array. This is done to handle cases where k is greater than or equal to the length of the array.

The expression nums[-k:] represents the last k elements of the list (the part that will be moved to the beginning of the rotated list), and the expression nums[:-k] represents the first n - k elements of the list (the part that will be moved to the end of the rotated list). By concatenating these two slices, we create a new list that represents the rotated version of the input list. The assignment nums[:] = modifies the input list in-place with the rotated list.\n",
